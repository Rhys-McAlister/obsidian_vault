This molecule is an example of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. They are a class of molecules very important to astronomers for a number of reasons, one of which is that they were thought to act as building blocks for the complex organic molecules that were related to the origin of life. 

Unfortunately these molecules are a complex structure property relationship which means they identifying their infrared spectrum can be a challenge. Additionally, there's alot of them so simply trying to brute force calculate every possible example of these molecules isn't feasible. 

So Kovacs and coworkers decided to use an ML based approach to make predictions of the spectra of these molecules to great success and they succeeded with orders of magnitude less computational expense than what would have been required from a first principles calculation.
