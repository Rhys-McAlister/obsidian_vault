This molecule is an example of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. They are a class of molecules very important to astronomers for a number of reasons, one of which is that they were thought to act as building blocks for the complex organic molecules that were related to the origin of life. 

Unfortunately these molecules are a complex structure property relationship which means they identifying their infrared spectrum can be a challenge. Additionally, there's alot of them so simply trying to brute force calculate every possible example of these molecules isn't feasible. 

So Kovacs and coworkers decided to use an ML based approach to make predictions of the spectra of these molecules to great success and they succeeded with orders of magnitude less computational expense than what would have been required from a first principles calculation.

**Exploring chemical space**. An interesting idea that arises from McGill and coauthors paper that I earlier mentioned is this idea of quantifying chemical space using molecular similarity metrics. In their approach they utilised a metric called the Tanimoto coefficient to represent their models predictive ability as a function of a given molecules similarity to all the other molecules they considered. They found that molecules in their test set performed poorly when they were chemically dissimilar to the molecules found in their train set which isn't a novel or surprising result but it does make us wonder how best we can address this deficiency of training data to cover the chemical space considered in astronomy applications. This is important as there is a wide variety of molecular classes to consider across the interstellar medium, terrestrial environments and even hot Jupiter environments.

**What is ML anyway?** Unfortunately this explanation is going to come with some nomenclature but I'll try my best not to inundate you. What we've discussed so far have been examples of what we'd call supervised learning. That's where we have some inputs and we have a model and that model will produce some output that we can compare against our true values to judge how accurate it will be. There's definitely some hand waving in that explanation but this approach isn't too dissimilar to what we might expect in traditional computational chemistry approaches. In our physics based models for comparison we can see that we also have some input that gets passed to our model, this model is instead based on some approximation to the Schrodinger equation. The defining difference however comes from this arrow here, in which our models have the ability to learn from the data and optimise for producing the best result it can produce (we hope).
