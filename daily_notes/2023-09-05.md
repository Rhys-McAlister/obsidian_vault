**Graph convolutions**

- Convolutions in the context of images refers to the process of sliding a convolutional filter over an image and at each step a weighted sum is calculated between the filter and the portion of the image it is currently operating over (the receptive field).

- We can consider filters to serve as a mechanism for detecting specific features. This approach of using filters for feature recognition is well suited for image data for the following reasons. Shift in-variance, the ability to recognise a feature regardless of its position within an image is key and is afforded by this approach. Assumption of locality, in that nearby pixels can be considered to be closely related. Hierarchy, larger portions of an image can be decomposed into combinations of various associated smaller components.

- Similarly to images, we can consider several priors which suggest that a convolutional approach is suitable for this data structure. Similarly to images, graphs have a locality prior in that we assume that nodes closer together are more relevant than those further away. The manner in which we define this is distinct however in that in images locality is defined by position in two-dimensional space where as locality in graphs is a structural notion (number of 'hops' away).
