## Executive Summary

High accuracy and high completeness spectral data is a highly valued and highly limited commodity that enables the definitive identification of molecular species. By improving our coverage of chemical space in terms of the availability of spectral data, the scope of our investigation into the chemical environments of exoplanet atmospheres would be greatly increased. This project will incorporate training data derived from  cutting edge quantum chemistry methodologies into a graph theoretical machine learning approach in order to produce approximate vibrational spectral data. Through this combination of quantum chemistry and machine learning, the ability of this system to produce approximate accuracy vibrational spectral data will be quantified and compared against the current state of the art results.
